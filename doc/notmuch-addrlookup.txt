===========================================================================
0. Usage ~

This plug-in lets you complete e-mail addresses in Vim by those found in your
inbox (or any other mail folder) via
https://github.com/pbrisbin/notmuch-addrlookup .
Useful, for example, when using Vim as editor for mutt (especially with
$edit_headers set).

When you're editing a mail file in Vim that reads
>
    From: Fulano <Fulano@Silva.com>
    To:   foo
<
and in your Inbox there is an e-mail from
>
    Mister Foo <foo@bar.com>
<
and your cursor is right after foo, then hit Ctrl+X Ctrl+O to obtain:
>
    From: Fulano <Fulano@Silva.com>
    To:   Mister Foo <foo@bar.com>
<

===========================================================================
1. Commands ~

To complete e-mail addresses inside Vim press CTRL-X CTRL-O in insert
mode. See |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| and |compl-omni|.

===========================================================================
2. Setup ~

1. Download and install (by make && sudo cp notmuch-addrlookup /usr/local/bin)
   notmuch-addrlookup from https://github.com/aperezdc/notmuch-addrlookup-c.
   If you are missing superuser rights, then compile it (by make) and add the
   path of the folder that contains the obtained executable notmuch-addrlookup
   to your environment variable $PATH:
   If you use bash or zsh, by adding to ~/.profile or ~/.zshenv the line
>
    PATH=$PATH:~/bin
<
2. If you like to filter out most probably impersonal e-mail addresses
   such as those coming from mailer daemons or accepting no reply, try
>
    let g:notmuch_filter = 1
<
   The regular expression which these addresses are checked against can be
   customized by the variable g:notmuch_filter_regex.

The plugin https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-mailquery lets you complete e-mail
addresses in Vim by those in your Inbox (or any other mail folder).

The plugin https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-mutt-aliases lets you
complete e-mail addresses in Vim by those in your mutt aliases file,
and (when the alias file is periodically populated by the
mutt-alias.sh shell script from https://github.com/Konfekt/mutt-alias.sh)
gives a more static alternative to this plug-in.
